# 🎮 Game Engine Fundamentals – Granny’s cats

Hey there, fellow DAE student, curious visitor, or game tech enthusiast 👋  
Welcome to my **Game Engine Fundamentals (Unity)** repository — a Unity prototype developed during the **third semester (2024)** at **DAE**.

## 🗄️ About this repository

This repository contains my **Unity project** for the **Game Engine Fundamentals** course.  
The purpose of the course was to **get familiar with both Unity and Unreal Engine**, focusing on **rapid prototyping**, **C# scripting**, and **iteration through feedback**.

Each student received two random words to creatively integrate into their project —  
I got **“rescue”** and **“sunrise”**, which became the foundation of my **3D zombie shooter** concept.

The game revolves around **surviving zombie waves**, **rescuing cats**, and **managing resources** between night and day cycles.  
Gameplay mechanics were designed to explore **Unity’s scripting API**, **prefab workflows**, and **HUD/UI systems**.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This project focuses on translating design ideas into functional gameplay within Unity — using scripting, prefabs, and feedback-driven iteration.  
It served as a creative challenge to combine randomly assigned words into a coherent 3D game while applying the fundamentals of game engine design.
